In purpose-built sparse data structures this is normally implicit or denoted only by shape metadata and possibly a fill value; in fold the array is explicit (since an overlay can have any array or view as its destination, just like an indexed assignment), but use of zero striding essentially reduces any constant-value array to its shape and a fill value, in terms of storage cost.\n",
